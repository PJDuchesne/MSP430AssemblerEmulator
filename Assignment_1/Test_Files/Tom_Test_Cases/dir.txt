; Test Case: Directive Testing
; This test case is for the first pass of the assembler
; The first pass should have an error for the lines specified
; Written by Tom Smith

; The following lines should NOT have an error within the first pass.

	orG	$1000	;LC should now be 1000
	ORg 	200	;LC should now be 00C8
label	BsS 	100	;LC should now be 012C
	byte 	20	;LC should now be 012D
	byte	-20	;LC should now be 012E

; The following should be shown for the values of the labels
; label = 00C8

; The following lines should give an error within the first pass

	equ 	label	;EQU requires a label in the same record

	byte	-200	;-200 too large for a byte
	byte	1000	;1000 too large for a byte
	byte	LABEL	;0FFF too lagre for a byte
	byte	$FFFF	;FFFF too large for a byte
	string 	hello	;string requires quotes
	string 	"hello	;string requires quotes on both sides
	string	hello"	;string requires quotes on both sides
