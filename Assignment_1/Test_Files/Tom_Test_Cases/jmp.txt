; Test Case: Jump Testing
; This test case is for the first pass of the assembler
; The first pass should have an error for the lines specified
; Written by Tom Smith

; The following lines should NOT give an error within the first pass

Label	jne	Label	;test relative addressing
	jeq	Label2	;test forward referencing
Label2  JGE     Label	
;
end
;The following lines should give an error

	jne	r1	;registers can not be jumped to
	jmp	Label(r1)	;indexed is not allowed for jumps
	jmp		;no operand should give an error
	jlo	@r1	;indirect is not allowed
	jl	@r9+	;indirect post increment also not allowed
