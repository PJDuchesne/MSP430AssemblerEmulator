; Test Case: Single Operand First Pass
; This test case is for the first pass of the assembler
; The first pass should have an error for the lines specified at the end of the file.
; Written by: Tom Smith

; The following lines should NOT have an error within the first pass.
	
	org	$1000
Label1	BSS	10
	RRA	#192		;Test decimal immediate
	RRA	#-100		;Test negative decimal immediate
	RRA	#$1abc		;Test hex immediate
;	RRA	#$-ff		;Test negative hex immediate
	RRC	r1		;Test direct addr mode
Label2	SwPB	label3		;Test forward reference when it is not in the symbol table
	PUSH	label3		;Test forward reference when it is already unknown
	PusH	&Label1		;Test absolute addressing mode
	sxt	@R12+		;Test indirect auto increment
	sXt	@r0		;Test indirect
label3	call	#label3		;Test immediate label
LabeL3	swpb	Label1(r1)	;Test indexed

end

; The following lines should induce an error in the first pass.

	RRA	#r1		;Registers can not act as immediates
	RRC	&R11		;Registers can not act as absolutes
	caLL	r1(label3)	;Registers have to be in the brackets in indexed.
	SXT	#-label3	;Labels can not be negative in immediate reference.
	rrC	label3(@r12+)	;Can not auto increment registers in indexed mode.
	SWPB	r1,r2		;Two operands should not be allowed
	RRA	#$label3	;label3 should not be able to be called as an immediate with the '$'
label	inst	#1		;Invalid instruction name
	RRC	;label		;The operand should be removed when the comment is removed from the string.
	SXT.B	#9		;There is no SXT.B instruction.
label1	Call	label1(label1)	;You can not put a label in the relative operand.
	RRA	end		;end is not a valid operand
	RRA	#$1ffff		;Exceed a word capacity
