; Test Case: Label Testing
; This test case is for the first pass of the assembler
; The first pass should have an error for the lines specified
; Written by Tom Smith

; The following lines should NOT have an error within the first pass

_label	org	$100	;Underscore to start test. Should have value 0
_1234	org	$0FFF	;Underscore with only numbers. Should have value 100
abc123	org	0	;normal  label. Should have value FFF.
AbC123			;make sure labels are case sensitive. Should have value 0.
aBC123	RRA	Abc123	;test more case sensitivity and forward referencing.
	RRC	Abc123	;make sure forward reference works when done twice
	ADD	ABCAB,&ABCAB	;make sure forward reference works with two operands
	rra	Abcab(r1)	;make sure forward referencing works with index
	rrc	#abcab		;make sure forward referencing works with immediates
Abc123
ABCAB;C			;should just make the label ABCAB
abcab;@@@@@@@@@@	;should just make the label abcab
Abcab	equ	$10	;should just make the label Abcab with value 10

; The following lines should give an error within the first pass

123abc	org	0	;labels can not start with numbers
abc abc	org	0	;labels can not have a space
abc$abc			;labels can not have special characters
a!bc			;labels can not have special characters

_label			;labels can not be duplicates
	RRC	org	;labels can not be named after directives
	RRA	add	;labels can not be named after instructions
	RRA	123ab	;labels can not start with numbers in forward referencing
thislabeliswaaaytoolongtobevalid	;labels can not exceed 31 characters. This label is 32.
