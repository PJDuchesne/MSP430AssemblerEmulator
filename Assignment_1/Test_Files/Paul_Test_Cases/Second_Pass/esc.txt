; ESCAPE CHARACTER AND END DIRECTIVE TEST
; Made by Paul Duchesne (B00332119)
; May 30, 2017

; Things to test
;	- Functionality of backslashes in the STRING directive
;	- \t, \0 (NULL), \r (Carriage return), and \n (End line) were implemented
; 	- Operand for END directive (Must be KNOWN from symbol table)
;

; Expected results: 0 failures in first pass and
;		    SREC should match SREC provided and
;		    diagnostics file should match opcodes
;		    written to the right of each line

	ORG 		$1000

	STRING 		"ABC"	; Should output 3 characters

	ORG 		$1500

	STRING 		"\t\t\t\t\t\a\e\t\d\z\b" ; Should output 11 characters

	ORG 		$2000
banana  STRING 		"\taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\t\r\n" ; Should output length minus the 4 backslashes
	STRING 		"\""
	STRING 		"\\"
	STRING 		"\0"
	STRING 		"\n"
	STRING 		"\r"
	STRING 		"\n"

	END	banana	; Final S9 record should emit to an address of 1000, as determined by banana

; These lines should all provide errors. In order to test, comment out the END directive above

	STRING 		"\n\"	; Should fail because the final character is escaped
	STRING 		""\n\"	; Should fail because the end quote is found too soon (and not escaped)
	STRING 		"\"	; Should fail because the final character is escaped

; EXPECTED OUTPUT OF S RECORDS (If the END is left in place)
