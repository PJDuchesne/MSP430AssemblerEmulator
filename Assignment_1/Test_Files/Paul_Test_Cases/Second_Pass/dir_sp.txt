; This tests DIRECTIVES in the second pass
; The following is a breakdown of what the directives do in the second pass
;
;	Align:		Aligns the LC to the next even memory location (THIS MUST COORDINATE WITH THE S1 BUFFER ADDRESS LOCATION, OR AT LEAST BE CONSISTENT WITH IT, Maybe just whenever we unload the S1 buffer, we also align the LC?)
;	BSS:		Moves the LC forward by the value after BSS, triggers an S1 buffer unload
;	BYTE:		Emits 1 BYTE of data to the S1 buffer
;	END:		Ends the file, triggers an S1 buffer unload followed by an S9 emission
;	EQU:		Nothing? This sets a thing to the symbol table in the first pass
;	ORG:		Sets the LC to the given value, triggers a S1 buffer unload
;	STRING:		Emits the characters in a given string 1 byte at a time to the S1 buffer
;	WORD:		Emits 1 WORD (2 bytes) of data to the S1 buffer
;

; Expected results: 0 failures in first pass and
;		    SREC should match SREC provided and
;		    diagnostics file should match opcodes
;		    written to the right of each line

			ORG 		$5000			; Should emit nothing, first S1 should 
LABEL2		EQU			1234			; Stores the value #1234 into LABEL2 ($04d2)
			STRING 		"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&*()[]{}y',."
										; Upper limit is 80 characters

			BYTE		123				; Stores #123 (1 byte) to the S1 buffer
			BSS			100				; THIS SHOULD TRIGGER BUFFER OUTPUT WITH ONLY #123 IN IT (Plus the overhead of an S1)
			ORG			$0400			; THIS SHOULD NOT TRIGGER A BUFFER OUTPUT

			WORD 		$1234			; Stores 1234 to buffer (in the order 34 12)
			WORD 		LABEL2			; LABEL2 should have 1234, this will be tested in the first pass test though
			WORD		-12313 			; Stores cfe7 to buffer (in the order e7 cf)

			ORG 		0200			; Cause an emit, new S1 should have a starting address of 0200

			STRING 		"jaksudhgnamknjhuyhjmjaksudhgnamknjhuyhjmjaksudhgnamknjhuyhjmjaksudhgnamknjhuyhjm"
										; This is 80 char, should work
			END							; Should emit the buffer

; Everything below should be ignored because of the END trigger, thus the lack of ";" to comment these
 
EXPECTED OUTPUT BELOW (Check the checksums)
