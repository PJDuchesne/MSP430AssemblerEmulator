; SINGLE OPERAND TEST CASE FOR FIRST PASS (Also "NONE" operand, RETI)
; Made by Paul Duchesne (B00332119)
; May 26, 2017

; Things to test
;	- All 7 addressing modes
;	- All instructions
; 	- Byte/Word INSTs
;	- FORWARD REFERENCES
;	- Register aliases
;	- Also RETI (0 Operand INST)

; Expected Results: All records should pass before Label3, after which all should fail
; Total: 9 errors (1 of which is from an unknown label)

		ORG	$0000

Label1		RRC	R7		
		SWPB	Label1(PC)	; Tests Register Alias (PC = R0)
		SXT	&Label2		; Tests forward reference
		RRA	#Label1		; Tests immediate label
		CALL	Label1
		PUSH	Label2(r10)	
		Reti			; 0 operand instruction
		RRC	#73		; Immediate addressing mode
		caLL	@R2		; Indirect addressing mode
		Sxt	@CG2+		; Indirect auto increment, with alias CG2 = R3

Label2		ORG	$1000

; All records below this line should fail

		ORG	$3000

Label3
		RETI	Label2		; Operand after 0 operand instruction
		PUSH	Label4		; Unknown label (Will be found in symbol table)
		RRC	R1,Label1(r2)	; Two operands for single operand instruction
		PUSH 	&r9		; Absolute must be on a valid label
		CALL	#-$200		; Invalid negative hex number
		Swpb	#$ffffc		; Number too large (Word max = 0xffff)
		RRA	#-40000		; Too large negative number (Max is -32768)
		SWPB.b  @R3		; SWPB does not have a .b and .w option, it is in word mode
		PISH    @R3		; Invalid instruction, will be added tos ymbol table and then R3 will cause an error
