; DIRECTIVE TEST CASE FOR FIRST PASS (Also "NONE" operand, RETI)
; Made by Paul Duchesne (B00332119)
; May 26, 2017

; Things to test
;	- All 9 directives
;	ALIGN;		Moves the LC forward to the next even byte increment
;	BSS:		Moves the LC forward by the value after BSS
;	BYTE:		Increments the LC
;	END:		Ends the file
;	EQU:		Sets the label infront of it to the value given
;	ORG:		Sets the LC to the given value
;	STRING:		Increases LC by length of string
;	WORD:		Increases LC by 2
;

; Expected Results: All records should pass before Lbl3, after which all should fail
; 		Note: the final "END" should still work
; Total: 9 errors (1 of which is from an unknown label)

	ORG	$5000
lbl0	Bss	$500	; LC moves to 0x5500
	BYTE	123	; Checks Byte range
	ALIGN		; WIll increase LC by 1 (LC is odd)
	BYTE	256	; Checks Byte range (Upper bound)
	BYTE    -128	; Lower bound
	ALIGN		; Will do nothing (LC is already even)
	WoRD	$ffff	; Upper word bound
	wORD	-32768	; Lower word bound
	WORD	$134	; Hex value in range

lbl2	EQU	$abc	; Sets lbl2 to 500
	String	"12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde"
			; upper bounds (80 characters, punch card width)
	String	""	; lower bounds (0)

; All lines below this should throw an error

lbl3	EQU	-325	; EQU cannot be negative
	BSS	70000	; Too large of a BSS range (LC max is 0xffff)
	ORG	$ffff1	; Too large ORG
	String ""abc"	; Invalid string (too many quotes)
	BYTE	257	; Just too large (positive)
	BYTE	-129	; Just too small (Negative)
	WORD	65537	; Just too large (positive)
	WORD	-32769	; Just too small (Negative)
	ALIGN 	lbl3	; Align does not take an operand
	END	lbl0	; END does not take an operand
	EQU	300	; EQU requires a label
	RRC	&label5	; Should be an unknown (In symbol table)
	ORG	-50	; ORG cannot be negative
	BSS	-500	; BSS cannot be negative

END			; All subsiquent lines should be ignored

label5	EQU	500
